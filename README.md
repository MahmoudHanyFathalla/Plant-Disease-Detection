# Plant-Disease-Detection
This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically a sequential model with various layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, and Dense. The model is trained on a dataset of images with two classes (Benign and Malignant), and the dataset is split into training and validation subsets.

The code also includes data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the dataset and reduce overfitting. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and SparseCategoricalCrossentropy loss function. Finally, the accuracy and loss of the model are plotted using Matplotlib.

This is the Link of the trained model that is ready to be used: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gAljWfJ-eMrApEkPxX1nTDJE5ERLR6in/view?usp=sharing
